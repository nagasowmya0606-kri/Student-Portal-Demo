Student Portal Demo

This repository contains a basic idea for a student portal application.

The student portal is a centralized platform that helps students access and manage academic information easily. 
Students can view their profile, enrolled courses, attendance, marks, and important announcements from the institution.

Main objectives of this project:
- Provide easy access to student academic data
- Improve communication between students and the institution
- Organize academic information in one place

This project is created for learning and demonstration purposes.
